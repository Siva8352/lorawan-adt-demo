This repository contains instructions and resources for helping you setup a complete end-to-end solution showcasing integration of LoRaWAN sensors into a digital twin solution.

It relies on The Things Stack/The Things Network for the LoRaWAN connectivity aspect, but it can easily be adapted to support other LoRaWAN network server, or any other sensor data source really.

## Pre-requisites

* Blender 2.91 (or later)  ‚Äî [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a free and open-source 3D modeling and rendering tool. You can [download it](https://www.blender.org/download/) from the project website.

* An Azure Subscription ‚Äî as you will be deploying several services in the Microsoft Azure cloud, you will need an Azure subscription. You can register for a free account [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/free).

* (optionally) Visual Studio Code ‚Äî while not mandatory, having a local install of Visual Studio Code will be useful.
